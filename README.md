## Description:

A website for the fictional company umbrella corp.

## How it was made

There are two branches, both made with html markup but one uses classic CSS while the other uses tailwind.

## Issues

While there are no failures, there are some features that could have been better done such as the designs on the about us sites, in the default css it forces horizontal scrolling and on the tailwind it takes up the first space completely not allowing any blocks to be placed next to it.
